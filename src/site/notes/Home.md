### Welcome to my digital garden!

This is to be something of a blog/brain dump as I go through life, hopefully improving my career and health[^1]

My goals for 2025 are thus - 
- get under 100kg
- be fully hired by ~~redacted~~
- figure out what I want to specialise in in my career

I would also like to keep improving my French - especially my speaking - and get back into singing and dancing. In amongst all of this, I need to squeeze in quality time with all of my loved ones, get back into fabric arts[^2] and get back into learning Spanish and Japanese.

*As you can see, I have a tendency to do too much.*

[^1]: I mean both my physical and mental health here. 

[^2]: Knitting, crochet, embroidery and cross stitch. Embroidery would be the priority.
