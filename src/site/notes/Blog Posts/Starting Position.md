As of this very moment, I am exhausted. I spent all weekend with family and friends and, while I feel loved and inspired from our time together, I am dreading the coming week as I am working 5 days instead of my usual 4 and I somehow have to fit in baking for work and an important doctor's appointment. 

I definitely overate this weekend, which tends to happen when I spend quality time with loved ones but I've also been overeating at work because of stress and boredom. 

In short, I am starting this project needing to curb my eating habits but, fortunately, feeling loved and supported by friends and family.
