As of this very moment, I am exhausted. I spent all weekend with family and friends and, while I feel loved and inspired from our time together, I am dreading the coming week as I am working 5 days instead of my usual 4 and I somehow have to fit in baking for work and an important doctor's appointment. 

I definitely overate this weekend, which tends to happen when I spend quality time with loved ones but I've also been overeating at work because of stress and boredom. Because my work's IT department is *very* slow, I am yet to actually *start* my job. **I started 3 months ago.** How am I supposed to learn and grow as a developer if all I'm doing is reading documentation and doing LinkedIn courses?

In short, I am starting this project needing to curb my eating habits and desperately needing to feel useful at work, but fortunately feeling loved and supported by friends and family.
